# ABOUT ME

I am a seasoned Software Engineer passionate about transforming ideas into scalable, data-driven solutions.  
My work leverages Python‚Äôs rich ecosystem, particularly **Django**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**, **PyQt5**, **Kivy**, and **Selenium**, to build efficient backend systems, cross-platform applications, automation pipelines, and real-time data services.

I specialize in:
- Designing RESTful APIs and WebSocket services for financial and academic domains.
- Developing desktop applications with modern UI/UX using PyQt5 and Kivy.
- Implementing scraping and browser automation tools using Selenium with FastAPI.
- Streaming live market data with asynchronous architecture and multithreading control.
- OCR systems - cloud based and custom solutions for data extraction.

With experience across **freelance, team-based**, and **solo developer roles**, I craft robust systems from the ground up, blending technical depth with business logic.
