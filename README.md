# ABOUT ME

I am a seasoned Python developer passionate about transforming ideas into scalable, data-driven solutions. My work leverages Python’s rich ecosystem—particularly **Django**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**, **PyQt5**, **Kivy**, and **Selenium**—to build efficient backend systems, cross-platform applications, automation pipelines, and real-time data services.

I specialize in:
- Designing RESTful APIs and WebSocket services for financial and academic domains.
- Developing desktop applications with modern UI/UX using PyQt5 and Kivy.
- Implementing scraping and browser automation tools using Selenium with FastAPI.
- Streaming live market data with asynchronous architecture and multithreading control.

With experience across **freelance, team-based**, and **solo developer roles**, I craft robust systems from the ground up, blending technical depth with business logic.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
1. **Financial Data Aggregator** – FastAPI-powered backend aggregating live data via WebSocket and REST from global markets (stocks, crypto, forex).
2. **Bloomberg Stream Integration** – Real-time `.ts`/`.m3u8` video stream handling using FastAPI with iframe UI control.
3. **Selenium + FastAPI Scraping Engine** – Automating dynamic finance websites using a multi-tab, class-based threaded browser manager.
4. **Multi-Platform Time Tracker** – Built in both PyQt5 and Kivy with persistent daily logs, color-coded controls, and local storage.
5. **School Admission Portal** – Full-stack Django + React system with form sectioning, Celery background tasks, and real-time chat via Django Channels.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
1. **LLM Integration and Fine-Tuning** – Customizing large language models to serve niche NLP use cases.
2. **Full-Stack Engineering** – Enhancing React + Django synergy with componentized UI and async API communication.
3. **Scrapy + Zyte API Optimization** – Competing in web scraping challenges using AI-assisted pipelines and multi-page logic.

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
1. **LLM & AI Engineering** – Tools involving embeddings, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and intelligent automation.
2. **FastAPI-Based Microservices** – Deployable APIs and WebSocket servers for high-frequency data platforms.
3. **Cross-Platform Tools** – Unified applications across desktop and web with shared logic (PyQt5/Kivy + FastAPI/React).
4. **Realtime Dashboards** – Trading or analytics dashboards with live data streaming and alerts.
5. **Educational Tech Tools** – From form automation to exam engines and student management systems.
